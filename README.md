## Description
Challenge 02  This weeks challenge tasked us to create a personal portfolio containing our porjects/challenges, an about me section, and a contact section.
### What was done
HTML - Mainly structure of the website, navbar, aboutme, projects, and contact.

CSS - Here I took my time trying to make the website as clean as possible, I wanted to go for a greyscale theme, just to bring more attention to functionality
with the nav bar for the project section, pseudos to make the website more interactive, and mobile functionality. Mainly I was just playing around. I also dont really
have a good cover photo, so I just included a picture of a cool face for now. Also the about me is just lorem for now aswell.

The project section I spent a good while doing, but im pretty happy it turned out well, what was difficult was trying to put content above the img, but
putting content below the image would be cleaner anyways so I ended up doing that.
 
for the footer I had nothing left to add, but the website looked akaward without it so I added a cool image to cover up the missing content.

The nav bar was pretty easy though, I followed a guide I thought looked cool, plus the JS part of it was simple. very good tutorial in my opinion.
Taught me good styling methods too.
