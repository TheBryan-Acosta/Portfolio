## Description
Challenge 01 Due September 26, This weeks challenge tasked us to update a clients website to meet accessibility standards,
in addition with cleaning and making the code more efficient.

### What was done
HTML - I started out by replacing the div tags with proper semantics, header for the header, main for the bulk content of the page, aside for the
benefits side panel, and footer for the footer.
Added section semantics for main and aside.
I had a chance to clean the code up by adding comments to seperate what each section was and formatting.
I caught a couple mistakes by the prev "Dev" forgetting the id for the first section in main.
I also made the p tags content easier to read by not having it all in one line.
Added the title of the website to display as Horiseon.
Gave alt tags to the images.

CSS - I removed the unnecessary classes given to the sections and other tags and instead targeted the sections
by the root class, example (.content section and .benefits section) for sections that had the same styling.
I reordered the css elements to properly match the content of the page top to bottom.
Assigned variables for repeated attribute values, mainly white and blue.
